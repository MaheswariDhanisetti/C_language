C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. 
It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.

Sections of the C Program
A C program is divided into six sections: 
Documentation
Link, Definition 
Global Declaration 
Main() function
Subprograms 

example:
#include <stdio.h> //Header Files Inclusion – Line 1
int main() { //Main Method Declaration – Line 2
  int a = 10;       //Body of Main Method – Line 3 to Line 6
  printf("%d", a);  //Statement – Line 4 
  return 0;  //Return Statement – Line 5
}

Here are some of the most important features of the C language:
Procedural Language -->In a procedural language like C step by step, predefined instructions are carried out.
Fast and Efficient --> It’s fast because statically typed languages are faster than dynamically typed languages.
Modularity -->The concept of storing C programming language code in the form of libraries for further future uses is known as modularity. 
Statically Type -->Meaning the type of variable is checked at the time of compilation but not at run time. This means each time a programmer types a program they have to mention the type of variables used
General-Purpose Language -->From system programming to photo editing software, the C programming language is used in various applications. 
Rich set of built-in Operators --> It is a diversified language with a rich set of built-in operators which are used in writing complex or simplified C programs.
Libraries with Rich Functions -->Robust libraries and functions in C help even a beginner coder to code with ease.
Middle-Level Language -->As it is a middle-level language so it has the combined form of both capabilities of assembly language and features of the high-level language.
Portability -->C language is lavishly portable as programs that are written in C language can run and compile on any system with either no or small changes. 
Easy to Extend -->means when a program is already written in it then some more features and operations can be added to it.

COMMENTS IN C:
The comments in C are human-readable explanations or notes in the source code of a C program. 
A comment makes the program easier to read and understand. These are the statements that are not executed by the compiler or an interpreter.
In C there are two types of comments in C language:
Single-line comment --> A single-line comment in C starts with ( // ) double forward slash. It extends till the end of the line and we don’t need to specify its end.
Multi-line comment --> The Multi-line comment in C starts with a forward slash and asterisk ( /* ) and ends with an asterisk and forward slash ( */ ).
Any text between /* and */ is treated as a comment and is ignored by the compiler.
